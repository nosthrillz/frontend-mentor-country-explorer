## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Bonus: I added pagination, so you can navigate through the list of countries

## My process

### Built with

- React.js with context
- Next.js with statically generated paths and props
- SCSS and CSS modules

### What I learned

I learned how to do pagination and I finally got some practice with getStaticPaths and getStaticProps.
The layout was no joke either.
### Continued development

I strongly believe the current component structure is not ideal. Architecture-wise, there are plenty improvements to be made.

I plan to come back and refactor for more "DRY"ness :)
